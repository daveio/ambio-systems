Got it. I’ve read the docs and the diagram.

Below are **logo directions**, not just aesthetics — each maps to how the system actually behaves. I’ll be blunt about what works and what to avoid.

(Anchored in the project description and architecture )

# Logo

This thing is **ambient, selective, privacy-aware, distributed, and physical**. The logo should reflect _control and restraint_, not surveillance-creep or “AI assistant” fluff.

I'm really liking the simple circle with delineations.

**Concept**

- Concentric rings or zones representing **capture states**:
  - inner = self
  - outer = environment
  - breaks = guards active

- The logo can _change_ subtly depending on mode.

**Why it fits**

- Your system is fundamentally **state-driven**.
- Ultrasonic presence, LAN presence, manual switch — all states.
- This gives you a path to **animated logo = system telemetry**.

**Execution notes**

- Static mark first; animation later.
- Should degrade gracefully to a single ring when tiny.
- Excellent for the phone app + pendant display.

**Avoid**

- Spinners.
- Pulsing “recording red dot” bullshit.
